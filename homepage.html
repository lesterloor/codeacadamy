    <h3>A little about myself</h3>
    <p> I am 26 years old and always had a passion for technology,
      growing up i would take apart of my electronics to try to understand how
      they work underneath and possibly customize them. It wasnt until i was 15
      that i managed to "hack" my Xbox 360 and play edit most games such as
      Call Of Duty, Halo, and others. Ever since then i have taught my self a bit of programming,
      and now im here trying to improve what I already know and learn more
